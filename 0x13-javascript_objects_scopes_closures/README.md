Javascript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

Function Prototypes ðŸ’¾ Prototypes for functions written in this project:

File Prototype 7-occurrences.js exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement) 8-esrever.js exports.esrever = function (list) 9-logme.js exports.logMe = function (item) 10-converter.js exports.converter = function (base)

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ 0. Rectangle #0 0-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines an empty class Rectangle.

Rectangle #1 1-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines a class Rectangle. Builds on 0-rectangle.js with: Constructor that initializes instance attributes width and height with given parameters w and h.

Rectangle #2 2-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines a class Rectangle. Builds on 1-rectangle.js with: If provided w and h are less than or equal to 0, creates an empty object.

Rectangle #3 3-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines a class Rectangle. Builds on 3-rectangle.js with: Instance method print() that prints the rectangle using the X character.

Rectangle #4 4-rectangle.js: JavaScript script that defines a class Rectangle. Builds on 4-rectangle.js with: Instance method rotate() that swaps the width and height of the Rectangle. Instance method double() that multiplies the width and height of the Rectangle by 2.

Square #0 5-square.js: JavaScript script that defines a class Square that inherits from Rectangle. Constructor takes one argument size.

Square #1 6-square.js: JavaScript script that defines a class Square that inherits from Rectangle. Builds on 5-square.js with: Instance method charPrint(c) that prints the Square using the character c. If c is undefined, uses the character X.

Occurrences 7-occurrences.js: JavaScript function that returns the number of occurrences in a list.

Esrever 8-esrever.js: JavaScript function that reverses a list.

Log me 9-logme.js: JavaScript function that prints the number of arguments already printed as well as the new argument value. Output: :

Number conversion 10-converter.js: JavaScript function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.

Factor index 100-map.js: JavaScript script that imports an array and creates a new array with each value equal to the value of initial list times the index of the new list. Prints both the initial and new list.

Sorted occurences 101-sorted.js: JavaScript script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user ID and computes a new dictionary of user ID's by occurrences. Prints the new dictionary.

Concat files 102-concat.js: JavaScript script that concatenates two files passed as arguments into a file specifed as the third argument. Usage: ./102-concat.js fileA fileB fileC.
